## What I Learned  
1. The main challenge was the extremely tight timeline, while still ensuring a high level of visual refinement. The design also needed to incorporate 3D elements, isometric illustrations, and a frosted texture. To achieve harmony across these diverse styles, color coordination was the key strategy.  
2. It’s worth consciously creating reusable assets during regular design practice—having a ready-made library can significantly speed up delivery in fast-paced projects.
