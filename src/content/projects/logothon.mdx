## Background

After completing the first Logothon, I began reflecting on the process—and as part of that reflection, this website was created.

1. I realized that even highly experienced or well-known developers—people with deep technical and intellectual insight—don’t necessarily have a foundation in design. It’s a different kind of literacy.
2. I wanted to document my own growth in a more structured and visible way. Doing so not only helps me share my progress with the world but also supports a healthy cycle for the project itself—potentially leading to commissioned work in the future.
3. I also needed more practical experience with **Astro**. Building this site, even through simple template adaptations, serves as hands-on learning for me.

## What’s next

1. This website will gradually expand into a **design guide for non-designers**.
   While many talented designers have written about such topics before, I want to present them in *my own way*—through personal case studies, behind-the-scenes process, and the evolution of Logothon itself.
   I’ll focus on insights drawn from my own experience, rather than critiquing others’ work. I’d like to share, not to judge.

   Perhaps because I’m not from a traditional design or art-school background, I tend to be more forgiving toward my own work. If something doesn’t look “stunning,” that’s fine—design is a process of understanding, not just perfection.
   (And really, who says that formal training guarantees a stunning design every time?)

2. Planned topics include:

   * How can we tell whether a logo is good or not?
     How do we evaluate multiple drafts beyond simple voting?
   * What makes communication with designers more effective?
   * How can designers participate meaningfully in open-source communities?
