title: MDB Landing Page
summary: From concept to visual execution, the project was completed independently. Blender was used to create looping 3D animations tailored to the scene, with a dark overall tone that made the accent color stand out prominently. A particularly interesting part of the process was learning to compress PNG image sequences into WebP format using ffmpeg. With the help of AI-assisted parameter tuning, the final videos achieved high visual quality while maintaining a remarkably small file sizeâ€”greatly improving page load performance.
