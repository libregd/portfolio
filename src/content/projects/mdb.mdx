title: MDB Landing Page
summary: From concept to visual execution, the project was completed independently. Blender was used to create looping 3D animations tailored to the scene, with a dark overall tone that made the accent color stand out prominently.

## What I Learned  
1. A particularly interesting part of the process was learning to compress PNG image sequences into WebP format using ffmpeg. With the help of AI-assisted parameter tuning, the final videos achieved high visual quality while maintaining a remarkably small file size—greatly improving page load performance.  
2. Strategic use of dark-themed color palettes can create the illusion of models entering and exiting the webpage, enhancing the immersive feel of the experience.

    </video>
  ))}

## Reviews Project  
1. The overall timeline was quite tight, but thanks to the client’s relaxed pacing and openness to exploring 3D effects, revisions were minimal—only one major change was made, switching the theme color from a blue-green gradient to an orange-yellow one.  
2. The initial visual direction was even pure white, aiming for a cold yet sharp aesthetic. However, given the number of new technologies I was already experimenting with, I ultimately opted for a more conventional dark-tech style to keep things manageable.
